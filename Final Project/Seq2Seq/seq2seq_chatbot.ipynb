I miss you moreeee!! Noo, I was busy:(\n Response: Do you really? Sigh\n\nPrompt: Me too but you know that both of us are busy\n Response: Baby boo, you need to relax sometimes even in between your busy schedules\n\nPrompt: I know, but I‚Äôm okay\n Response: Baby, I know you're super busy but I just wanted to send you a quick message telling me what I truly feel. I feel like because of the workload that we both have at Minerva, we are putting less and less effort into nurturing our relationship. This is both sad and concerning for me because I know that this is exactly how people drift apart over time, which is something I would NEVER want happen to us. It's okay to be busy, but during those times when we are not, let us put all our heart and soul into recording/writing messages for each other - it was my fauly yesterday for neglecting that. So let's pinky promise each other that despite being busy, we still care about each other and share our feelings with one another, because baby boo - there's not one else I'd rather be in a relationship with other than you. I want you, Anzhelika, and I always will. I hope you will too. Ô∏è\n\nPrompt: I am glad you see that there's actually a problem\n Response: I do see that so let's do something about it\n\nPrompt: You know that we both record videos/send messages No matter what\n Response: yes, but it's the enthusiasm that counts you didn't seem that way today even when I woke up You were not using emojis even during the call I could feel it\n\nPrompt: Yes! And I appreciate that you do talk about it\n Response: Cool So yeah\n\nPrompt: Cool?\n Response: what are we going to do about it?\n\nPrompt: I'll try to be more \"enthusiastic\"\n Response: sigh okay\n\nPrompt: What are your suggestions?\n Response: I just want my normal Anzhelika back that's all I don't need anything else Just be yourself\n\nPrompt: I AM NORMAL\n Response: no you're not\n\nPrompt: I was typing from my laptop, it's hard to use emojis\n Response: lol what an excuse\n\nPrompt: It's not an excuse\n Response: I'm typing from my laptop too\n\nPrompt: But you know that I don't usually use emojis\n Response: that you don't even use it suuuuure\n\nPrompt: Because for me it's not comfortable I told you that a couple of times\n Response: you do use emojis when you're being normal\n\nPrompt: And guess what, you haven't even answered the questions I asked you in my messages AGAIN\n Response: and cheesy I replied to everything la\n\nPrompt: that was sent through my phone\n Response: and it was partly because you were being so aloof in the videos I was feeling horrible cause to me it felt like you didn't love me as much anymore\n\nPrompt: I asked you smth didn't I\n Response: \"ally\" is a term la\n\nPrompt: If it's a term, it doesn't mean that you have to ignore me\n Response: fine, I'm sorry but it was because of this and this\n\nPrompt: I wasn't aloof in videos\n Response: you were\n\nPrompt: I was just feeling tired\n Response: I could see that\n\nPrompt: And I had to go and work\n Response: tired doesn't mean you can't be cheesy\n\nPrompt: Tired is a mental state in my case\n Response: yeah that's the thing, I don't want us to neglect our relationship amidst our work\n\nPrompt: I don't want anything I feel horrible But do you even care\n Response: why? I DO OMG you didn't tell me that\n\nPrompt: Do you even know how was my day\n Response: how was your day? you were busy working that's why you didn't send me messages for 7 hours\n\nPrompt: But you do that too\n Response: it's okay though and it's my fault, I hate myself for doing that I told you, I don't want to become like that I don't want us to take what we have for granted become too complacent with each other\n\nPrompt: Sometimes you work like that too, and it's okay\n Response: I want us to have a healthy relationship It's actually not, I need a break sometimes\n\nPrompt: You know, it was okay, thank you for asking\n Response: sure you just said you felt horrible\n\nPrompt: Baby, you need to go start your day\n Response: are you chasing me off now\n\nPrompt: You have two classes to do, you have interviews, civic project, an assignment that you need to put effort in\n Response: tell me about your day\n\nPrompt: If you call it like that\n Response: baby stop I shouldn't have told you this sigh\n\nPrompt: Why not? You think that I don't deserve to know what you are doing?\n Response: but now you don't wanna talk to me anymore because of that so yeah I think it's counterintuitive\n\nPrompt: I want you to start working, because then you won't have time to eat lunch properly or even worse be hungry\n Response: sigh but you won't even tell me about your day what did you do in those 7 hours\n\nPrompt: my day was good\n Response: you didn't tell me that\n\nPrompt: Ugh Everything is fine\n Response: IT IS NOT FINE\n\nPrompt: I am alive and healthy\n Response: it clearly isn't\n\nPrompt: What else can I wish for\n Response: why are you not being honest with me\n\nPrompt: You know that this conversation won't bring you anything useful, right?\n Response: that wasn't my intention\n\nPrompt: So please just go to work I am fine And I'll be fine\n Response: I just want to help you feel better no you're not tell me please\n\nPrompt: I'll tell you when I go to bed, okay baby?\n Response: ughhhhh stop pushing me away when I'm trying to help you\n\nPrompt: There's nothing to help with Stop offering me help\n Response: so you don't want to talk to me? just say it I'll leave you alone Just say that you don't want to talk to me and that I'm annoying for asking to help you\n\nPrompt: I think I have explained to you how busy you are\n Response: we're not talking about me we're talking about yuo\n\nPrompt: And that I am FINE\n Response: SURE why don't I believe you\n\nPrompt: I should ask you\n Response: Fine. If you don't want my help, I'll leave you alone. Good later baby Ô∏è\n\nPrompt: You are using dots now? Huh\n Response: Yes, because you don't even want to share your feelings with me\n\nPrompt: Yeah, you know what Leave me alone\n Response: Okay Good later Can we not fight, please? I already miss you so freaking much this hurts even more\n\nPrompt: Baby We are not fighting You just decided to leave me alone Okay let me paraphrase it in a less dramatic way You went to study\n Response: You know that I would never do that\n\nPrompt: And that‚Äôs good But you did\n Response: Hahaha sorry that was kinda funny I was just frustrated that you wouldn't tell me how you felt and you wouldn't let me in you keep shutting me out pushing me away what am I supposed to do? stand outside the door in the freezing cold? I wanted to come in but you kept saying no\n\nPrompt: And that‚Äôs how everything actually ends Because everyone is frustrated\n Response: well not us\n\nPrompt: Leave me alone, exactly what you did baby\n Response: NO. I'm not doing that I'll be here\n\nPrompt: Yeah you are right You need to walk away\n Response: I'll always be here Whenever you're ready to talk I'll be right here waiting for you in the freezing cold even if I freeze to death I'll never leave so whenever you feel like talking just let me know open the door for me and let me give you a big fat warm hug kiss your lips\n\nPrompt: You just told me that what else can you do if I keep shutting the doors\n Response: I'll keep waiting I can do this forever\n\nPrompt: You cannot do that right now So why do you keep bringing it up\n Response: because you're the woman I want to be with and you are worth waiting for I know it hurts, but to me, the ability to even imagine that is way better than the inability to even picture that at all Hahaha my baby is watching my videos I didn't know you liked those videos I thought you didn't like me playing the piano haha\n\nPrompt: What are you saying? Like honestly\n Response: and that's why I don't do it anymore I haven't been playing for almost half a year now, haven't you noticed?\n\nPrompt: So you are blaming me now?\n Response: not you\n\nPrompt: I told you so many times that I love when you play\n Response: sure okay\n\nPrompt: I rewatched the video with Lexi multiple times for the past 6 months But sure\n Response: that was so bad\n\nPrompt: It‚Äôs your choice\n Response: I wasn't even playing that well\n\nPrompt: Haven‚Äôt I noticed that you don‚Äôt have a piano I‚Äôm such a bad girlfriend omg\n Response: wait what I'm confused why do you say so?\n\nPrompt: Because I don‚Äôt notice that you don‚Äôt play the piano, especially for the past 6months, exactly how we started dating\n Response: I mean it's not you it's the fact that I don't have access to a piano a decent one at lease\n\nPrompt: But I should have noticed that\n Response: I mean sure that would've been nice\n\nPrompt: If you told me that you miss me baking or swimming, I would also appreciate it you know\n Response: Hey I do say that\n\nPrompt: Because we talk about cooking every freaking day We do it 3 times a day\n Response: huh im confused cooking is not baking they are different things\n\nPrompt: Always?
